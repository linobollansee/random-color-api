# Coding Challenge: Random Color Generator API

## Goal

Create a simple API using Express.js and TypeScript that generates random color value in various formats (Hex, RGB, HSL) and returns them as a JSON response.

## Requirements

- Setup a new Node.js project with Express.js and TypeScript.
- Create API Endpoint that returns a new random color with each request.
- The generated color must be available in the following formats:
  - Hexadecimal
  - RGB
  - HSL
- The api response should be in json
- You are able to use npm packages

## Bonus Task: Frontend Integration

Create a simple frontend that consumes the API you've built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks allowed.

### Requirements

Display a user interface that contains:

- A box for the hex, rgb and hsl code
- Each box should have copy button to copy the value
- A button to retrieve a new random color
- the whole body should display the chosen color
